# Hidden in plainsight

:::penguin_oldmoney
This is an easy forensics challenge. The clue is to discover "hidden" payload and "extract" the flag.

Whenever I got an image in a forensics challenge, first step is to use exiftool. The image given is named img.jpg. I downloaded the image to my local linux machine.
:::

```shell
exiftool img.jpg
```

Below is the result of the command.

```shell
…/forensics/hidden-in-plainsights ❯ exiftool img.jpg

```

As you can see in the comment, there's a weird looking string. I would assume it is a base64 encoded string. So I try to decode the string using below command.

```shell
echo "c3RlZ2hpZGU6Y0VGNmVuZHZjbVE9" | base64 --decode
```

Output = ` steghide:cEF6endvcmQ= `

There's another clue given there, `steghide`, that means we need to use steghide tool to solve this challenge, but first let's decode the base64 string given. I would assume that's the password to be used with steghide.

```shell
echo "cEF6endvcmQ=" | base64 --decode
```

Output = `pAzzword`

Now that we know what tool to use and the password, we can move on to the next step.

:::tip
Run `steghide --help` if you don't know what command and flags to use.
:::

```shell
steghide --extract -sf img.jpg -p pAzzword
```

Output = `wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".`

I run `ls` to list all available files inside my directory, and yes there's a new file created named `flag.txt`

Next just run `cat` command to print the content of the text file

```shell
cat flag.txt
```

Output = `picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_1m4g3_1c55ccd0}`

_Voila!_
