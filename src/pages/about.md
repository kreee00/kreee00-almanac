title: About Me
---

I’m a Computer Science student at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) driven by a passion for cybersecurity, digital transformation, and open-source technologies. I enjoy exploring real-world tech challenges in automation, reliability, and threat detection.

During my internship with ERS Energy’s Digital Team, I worked on projects that enhanced operational efficiency and security visibility, from automating HR workflows with Appsheet to deploying Prometheus, Grafana, and Wazuh for monitoring and endpoint security.

Outside work, I actively compete in global Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and am an Omarchy OS daily user who loves experimenting with open-source tools.

I’ve also served as General Secretary of UTP’s Student Representative Council (2023/2024), led CYBERHAX (UTP’s Cybersecurity Club), and currently represent Dewan Belia Perak Sesi-5, experiences that have strengthened my leadership, communication, and mentoring skills.

Curious, collaborative, and growth-driven, I aim to contribute to a more secure and innovative digital future.
